# About project
This project is developed for Multimedia University, Faculty of Information Science and 
Technology, subject TML2221 Machine Learning. 
This project is for facial recognition using facial images with medical mask selfie acquired by the smartphone/webcam camera. In this project, our group will develop a medical mask facial recognition system using Machine Learning approach. By using Jupyter and Google Colab, we use python as our programming language to develop the program. Furthermore, with the project assignment requirement, we were told to generate 5 different machine learning algorithm methods. Thus, our decision is Logistic Regression, Multilayer Perceptron, Convolutional Neural Network, Random Forest Classifier and Support Vector Machine. Some of the algorithms require further feature extract, so Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is used as a dimension reduction technique. Our goal is to find the highest accuracy within these 5 algorithms method and decide which is the best.

# How to use the code
